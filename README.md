<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In my first year of University the amount of differnet events was incredibly overwelming. Most of which spread across multiple platforms. I decided to create a platform where not only could people find all relevant events, but for event organisers to publish new events. 

Key Features:
* Easy sign in with google
* List of all events created by an individual
* Create new events

## Planning

### Resources

A resource I like to use when planning pages is from Fireship.io. This flow chart makes the choice of SSR or CSR much easier to wrap my head around

<br />

### Design

I then began designing the site and how I anticipate it to function. This includes the component trees, any get or post requests, authentification, styling and overall layout of the page

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
